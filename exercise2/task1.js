//  Letâ€™s consider a backend service that performs a set of asynchronous tasks: A, B, C, D and E.
// The task dependencies are: Tasks A and B are independent; Task C depends on Task A; Task D
// depends on Task B and Task C; Task E depends on Task D.
// a. Submit a nodeJS code snippet in tasks1.js, that executes these asynchronous tasks in
// the expected order, each accepting and passing data locally to/from each other as
// defined above.
// b. Suppose Task A works on a HUGE dataset, consuming massive compute and time
// resources. Demonstrate in tasks2.js, how you would reconfigure the tasks, if Task A
// were to be broken up to work sequentially on N smaller chunks of data

// SCENARIO A (task1)
